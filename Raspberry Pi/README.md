Connecting Raspberry Pi to DiamondMind
======================================

Two options - both involve projects outside of the DiamondMind ecosystem so we simply provide the links to the various options, instructions and updates will all be found there.

1) OctoPi with bundled OctoPrint.

Download OctoPi image for RPi:
https://github.com/guysoft/OctoPi

Follow instructions to extract image to SD Card.
Follow instructions to connect via browser and start uploading .gcode and printing.

2) Install OctoPrint into an existing Raspbian-based Raspberry Pi install.

OctoPrint provides a responsive web interface for controlling a 3D printer (RepRap, Ultimaker, ...). 
It is Free Software and released under the GNU Affero General Public License V3.
